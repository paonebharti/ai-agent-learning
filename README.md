# AI Agent Learning Journey

This repository documents my **day-by-day learning journey into AI Agent development**, following a structured roadmap. Each day focuses on understanding core concepts and implementing small, hands-on experiments using Python.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in agent-based systems through consistent practice, experimentation, and incremental improvements.

## 📅 Progress

### ✅ Day 1
- Environment setup (Python, virtual environment)
- Understanding what AI agents are and where they are used
- Basic project structure and tooling

### ✅ Day 2
- Built a simple FastAPI application to interact with an agent
- Learned how request handling works in FastAPI
- Used Pydantic models for request validation
- Tested endpoints using `curl`
- Understood basic concepts like ASGI servers and Uvicorn

### ✅ Day 3
- Path & query parameters
- Status codes
- Controller-style API design
